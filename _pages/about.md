## About this site

This website was built using the [AcademicPages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted freely via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It uses structured Markdown and YAML to separate content from formatting, allowing easy updates and data-driven content generation (like dynamic CVs or maps of speaking locations).

To build your own site like this, [check out the template repo here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
